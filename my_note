Thank you very much, liao.
That's the second time to learn git from the web!
When I first finish the learning, I thought I got all the messages forever!
In fact, for tools like git, the prodecessors invented it for the common life.
Only the use in common life can help you be a master!
Have learnt a lot!
Thank you very much again!
